 abstract = {Ectoine (1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimidine-carboxylic acid) is formed in various bacteria as a cell protectant against all kinds of stress. Its preservative and protective effects on proteins, cells, and tissues have enabled various applications in medicine, cosmetics and biotechnology, and ectoine therefore has high commercial value. Industrially, ectoine is produced using extremophilic microbes in a complex high-salt process, which imposes constraints on the costs, design and durability of the fermentation system. In this study, the soil microbe Corynebacterium glutamicum was upgraded for the heterologous production of ectoine from sugar and molasses. To overcome previous limitations, the flux through the three-step ectABC pathway taken from Pseudomonas stutzeri was engineered using transcriptional balancing. For this purpose, a library with 185,193 possible variants was created, which randomly combined 19 synthetic promoters and 3 linker elements for monocistronic expression of the ectoine cluster. Screening of the library led to the discovery of several high-titer mutants with an improvement of almost fivefold over the initial strain. Sequencing revealed that high production relied on a specifically balanced ectoine pathway. High flux was achieved when the protein level of EctB was significantly higher than that of EctA and when the total protein amount of all ectoine enzymes was low. In an optimized fermentation process, the newly discovered top producer C. glutamicum ectABCopt achieved an ectoine titer of 65 g L-1 and a specific productivity of 120 mg g-1 h-1 . Our process is the first reported example of a simple fermentation process under low-salt conditions using well-established feedstocks to produce ectoine with industrial efficiency. There is a compelling case for more intensive implementation of transcriptional balancing in the future metabolic engineering of C. glutamicum. This article is protected by copyright.
