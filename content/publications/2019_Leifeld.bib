 abstract = {A new method of curve form based quantization of short time series data is proposed here for the modeling and analysis of the dynamics in biological systems. We use a smoothing spline to fit our data with predefined qualitative curve forms as constraints firstly. Then we determine the significant curve form based on the generalized cross validation. After that, we calculate a pattern fit to quantize data according to the curve form. The proposed method selects the number of quantization stages automatically and reduces the influence of noise. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the proposed approaches.},
