# Biological data science

Modern technologies now allow researchers to simultaneously study biological organisms and processes across various molecular layers and in diverse biological contexts. To leverage this wealth of data, we are developing advanced methods for both supervised and unsupervised analysis of multi-modal omics data using cutting-edge machine learning and statistical modeling techniques. As part of fslabs.org, we contribute to the open-source data analysis library environment, ensuring that our innovations are accessible to the broader research community. Our methods enable comprehensive, data-driven integration and analysis of data derived from multiple omics technologies and varied biological scenarios, thereby enhancing our understanding of complex biological systems.
