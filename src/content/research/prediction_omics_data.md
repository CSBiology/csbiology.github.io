# Prediction of acclimation modulators and integrators based on ‘omics data 

Acclimation responses involve complex interactions among genes, proteins, and metabolites, resulting in both general and specific elements. Previously, we focused on extracting response-specific structural models from complex 'omics data using functional constraint aggregation and network topology inference.

Predicting modulators and integrators based on regulatory network topology and differential expression levels remains challenging, especially with limited acclimation data. However, incorporating additional regulatory characteristics of proteins—such as thermostability, aggregation propensity, intrinsic disorder, and post-translational modifications—can improve this identification. 

This project proposes a novel approach using sequential meta-learning to integrate these regulatory characteristics, overcoming data sparsity challenges. In collaboration with CRC experimental groups, we will test our model’s predictions by introducing thermostable protein homologs into plant and algal cells. These experiments are expected to reduce acclimation capabilities and cause growth retardation, validating our approach in experimental evolution assays.
