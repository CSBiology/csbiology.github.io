 abstract = {Cellular stressors are abundant and diverse, and they can be acute or chronic andmild~or intense. Accordingly, the stress response is complex, involving transcription,RNA~stability, translation, protein turnover, and changes in interactions, as wellas modifications and re-localization of molecules. Different response types have theirspecific triggers, regulators, and dynamics, with the common goal of reestablishingcellular health.},
