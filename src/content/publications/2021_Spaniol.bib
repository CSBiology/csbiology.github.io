 abstract = {We have identified the homolog of LOW PSII ACCUMULATION 2 (LPA2) in Chlamydomonas. A Chlamydomonas lpa2 mutant grew slower in low light, was hypersensitive to high light, and exhibited aberrant structures in thylakoid membrane stacks. The Fv/Fm value was reduced by 38{\%}. Synthesis and stability of newly made PSII core subunits D1, D2, CP43, and CP47 were not impaired. However, complexome profiling revealed that in the mutant CP43 was reduced to {\~{}}23{\%} and D1, D2, and CP47 to {\~{}}30{\%} of wild-type levels. Levels of PSI and the cytochrome b6f complex were unchanged, while levels of the ATP synthase were increased by {\~{}}29{\%}. PSII supercomplexes, dimers, and monomers were reduced to {\~{}}7{\%}, {\~{}}26{\%}, and {\~{}}60{\%} of wild-type levels, while RC47 was increased {\~{}}sixfold and LHCII by {\~{}}27{\%}. We propose that LPA2 catalyzes a step during PSII assembly without which PSII monomers and further assemblies become unstable and prone to degradation. LHCI antenna were more disconnected from PSI in the lpa2 mutant, presumably as an adaptive response to reduce excitation of PSI. From the co-migration profiles of 1734 membrane-associated proteins, we identified three novel putative PSII associated proteins with potential roles in regulating PSII complex dynamics, assembly, and chlorophyll breakdown.},
